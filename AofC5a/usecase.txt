Use Case: Determine Fresh Ingredient IDs
Primary Actor

Kitchen Inventory System (invoked by an Elf)

Stakeholders & Interests

Kitchen Elves – Want to know which available ingredients are fresh so they can safely prepare meals.

Inventory Manager – Wants accurate classification based on the defined fresh ID ranges.

System – Needs to correctly parse ranges and IDs, handle invalid inputs, and report reliable results.

Preconditions

A database file is available containing:

One or more fresh ingredient ID ranges in the form a-b, inclusive.

A blank line.

One or more available ingredient IDs, one per line.

File is readable and accessible.

Postconditions

The system reports:

A list or count of which available ingredient IDs are fresh.

Any invalid ranges or IDs encountered during processing.

Main Success Scenario (MSS)

Elf provides the ingredient database file to the system.

System reads the file and separates:

The set of fresh ID ranges.

The set of available ingredient IDs.

System validates the structure:

Ensures all ranges are in start-end format.

Ensures IDs are integers.

For each fresh range:

System expands or stores the numeric interval (inclusive).

For each available ingredient ID:

System checks whether the ID falls within any fresh range.

System marks the ID as:

Fresh (if within at least one range), or

Spoiled (otherwise).

System counts the number of fresh ingredients.

System outputs the result, e.g.:

“3 of the available ingredient IDs are fresh.”

System logs successful completion.

Extensions (Error Handling)
3a. Invalid range format

3a1. System detects malformed range (e.g., missing hyphen, non-numeric bounds).

3a2. System logs an error specifying the offending line.

3a3. System skips the invalid range and continues processing.

3a4. If no valid ranges remain, system reports:

“No valid fresh ID ranges found — cannot classify ingredients.”

3b. Invalid ingredient ID format

3b1. System encounters a non-integer available ID.

3b2. System logs the issue.

3b3. System skips that ID and continues.

4a. Overlapping or unsorted ranges

4a1. System normalizes them (merge where possible or simply evaluate inclusively).

4a2. Processing continues without failure.

5a. No available ingredient IDs found

5a1. System reports:

“No available ingredient IDs provided — nothing to classify.”

7a. Output channel failure (e.g., cannot write to console/file)

7a1. System retries output.

7a2. If still failing, system logs:

“Unable to output results due to system error.”

Supporting Information
Range Inclusion Logic

A fresh range a-b contains all integers a ≤ x ≤ b.
A given ID is fresh if any defined range contains it.

Example From Problem

Fresh ranges:

3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18


Available IDs:

1  → spoiled  
5  → fresh  
8  → spoiled  
11 → fresh  
17 → fresh  
32 → spoiled  


Result: 3 fresh IDs
