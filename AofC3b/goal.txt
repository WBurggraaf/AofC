These use cases aim to compute the maximum possible joltage values from battery banks in the escalator’s emergency power system.

Each bank is given as a sequence of digits (1–9), and the system must extract the strongest possible joltage without reordering digits. 
In Part 1, it selects the best two-digit combination formed by two digits that occur in left-to-right order. 
In Part 2, it deterministically selects exactly 12 digits in order to form the largest possible 12-digit number. 
The system validates all banks, rejects malformed or too-short inputs, and ensures deterministic, order-preserving selection. 
For every valid bank, the computed joltage is added to a running total, which is returned along with per-bank results. 
The goal is to give technicians reliable, maximized joltage values for restoring escalator power quickly and safely.
