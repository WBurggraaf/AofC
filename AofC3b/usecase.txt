USE CASE: Compute Maximum 12-Battery Joltage per Bank

Primary Actor:
• User

Supporting Actors:
• Joltage Selection Algorithm (internal system responsibility)

Stakeholders and Interests:
• User: Wants the system to generate the maximum possible 12-digit joltage value for each battery bank without rearranging digits.
• System: Must apply deterministic selection rules and produce correct numeric results.

Preconditions:
• Input consists of zero or more banks.
• Each bank is a non-empty sequence of digits 1–9.
• Valid banks for Part 2 contain at least 12 digits.

Postconditions:
• For each valid bank, exactly one 12-digit joltage value is produced.
• The total output joltage is the sum of all valid per-bank results.
• Invalid banks are reported and excluded from the total.

Main Success Scenario:

The user provides the full list of battery banks.

For each bank, the system validates the line as a sequence of digits 1–9 with length ≥ 12.

For each valid bank, the system invokes the Joltage Selection Algorithm to choose exactly 12 digits in original order that maximize the resulting numerical value.

The system constructs the joltage by concatenating the 12 selected digits.

The system adds this value to the running total.

After all banks are processed, the system returns the total joltage.

Extensions:
2a. Bank contains fewer than 12 digits.
 1. The system reports the bank as invalid.
 2. The system excludes the bank from processing and from the total.

2b. Bank contains characters not in 1–9.
 1. The system reports the bank as invalid.
 2. The system excludes the bank from the total.

3a. Multiple digit sequences within the bank offer equal maximal prefixes.
 1. The Joltage Selection Algorithm deterministically chooses the leftmost maximal candidate, ensuring consistent behavior.

4a. The 12-digit number begins with a lower digit than an early alternative choice.
 1. The system ensures the algorithm has enforced the rule that the earliest possible larger digit must be chosen if feasible under remaining-length constraints.

6a. Total value exceeds fixed-size integer range.
 1. The system uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
 2. If unavailable, the system reports numeric overflow.

Special Requirements:
• The chosen digits must preserve their original left-to-right order.
• Exactly 12 digits must be selected for each valid bank.
• The Joltage Selection Algorithm must maximize the numerical result and be deterministic.
• Each bank is processed independently.
• The system must support large integer results.

Frequency of Occurrence:
• Once per input set.

Open Issues:
• None.
