Use Case: Generate Maximum Joltage for Each Battery Bank
Scope

Escalator Emergency Power System

Level

User goal

Primary Actor

Maintenance Technician (the player/you)

Stakeholders & Interests

Maintenance Technician – Wants to restore escalator power as fast as possible by calculating the maximum available joltage from each battery bank.

Escalator System – Needs valid joltage input to operate; fails safely if invalid data is provided.

Facility Operations – Want escalator operational for transport continuity.

Elf Technician – Wants the escalator powered so she can focus on fixing the elevators.

Preconditions

The system has access to the full list of battery banks.

Each bank is represented as a line of digits, each digit 1–9.

Each bank contains at least two batteries.

Minimal Guarantees

System returns a clear error message if the input is invalid.

No partial or corrupted computations are output.

Success Guarantees

For each battery bank, the system identifies the two digits which, in their original left-to-right order, form the maximum possible two-digit joltage.

System outputs a single total (sum) of all banks’ maximum joltages.

Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)

Technician requests joltage computation.
The technician submits the puzzle input containing multiple lines of digits.

System validates the input format.

Every non-empty line must contain only digits 1–9.

Each line represents one battery bank.

System iterates through each battery bank.

For a given bank, system scans left to right to find the highest possible two-digit combination.

The system locates the highest-valued digit in the bank.

Then, among digits to its right, finds the highest possible digit that forms the largest two-digit number with the first.

If multiple options exist, the earliest optimal pair is chosen.

System computes the bank's maximum joltage (e.g., digits 9 and 8 → “98”).

System adds the bank's maximum joltage to a running total.

After all banks are processed, system outputs:
a. A list of max joltages per bank
b. The total joltage sum

Technician reviews the result and uses it to power the escalator.

Extensions (Error & Alternate Handling)
2a. Invalid Characters Found

Condition: A line contains characters other than digits 1–9 (e.g., spaces, zeros, letters).

System Action:

Rejects the full input.

Returns: “Error: Each battery bank must contain only digits 1–9.”

Outcome: Technician corrects input and retries.

2b. Bank Has Fewer Than Two Batteries

Condition: A line contains only one digit.

System Action:

Rejects computation for this line.

Returns error specifying offending line.

Outcome: Technician must fix the battery list.

3a. Empty Lines

Condition: A blank line appears between banks.

System Action:

Ignores blank lines or optionally warns user depending on system configuration.

4a. Highest digit occurs only at the last position

Condition: Highest digit is at the final index; cannot serve as first digit of a two-digit pair.

System Action:

The system instead selects the next-highest eligible digit that has at least one digit to its right.

7a. Total Joltage Overflow

Condition: Extremely large input causes total to exceed system integer limits.

System Action:

Raises “Computation Overflow” error.

Suggests chunked processing or system upgrade.

Special Requirements

Must preserve original left-to-right order of digits.

Must not sort or rearrange batteries.

Output must be deterministic given the same input.

Large inputs (thousands of banks) must compute within reasonable time.

Technology & Data Variations

Format Variants:

Input may come from a scanner, text field, terminal, or file.

Output Variants:

JSON for machine use.

Text for technician readability.

Diagnostic mode including per-bank digit selection steps.
