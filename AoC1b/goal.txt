Part 1 only checks the dial at the end of each turn: if it stops on 0, you count it once.
Part 2 watches every single tick while the dial turns: every time it passes through 0, you count it, even if that happens many times in one turn.

The whole goal of the assignment was to read a list of turning instructions for a circular dial numbered 0 to 99 and 
figure out a secret password based on how often the dial reaches 0. First you solve it using the simpler rule 
that only checks where the dial ends after each instruction. Then you solve it again using the updated security rule 
that counts every moment the dial lands on 0 while moving. The challenge is to simulate the dial correctly, 
handle wrap-around from 99 to 0, and make sure long rotations are counted properly.
