The goal of these use cases is to ensure the Gift Shop’s product database remains accurate and free of erroneous product IDs. 

The system (or Visiting Helper) receives numeric ID ranges and must scan every ID to detect those that follow an 
invalid repetition pattern—either a sequence repeated exactly twice (basic rules) or two or more times (enhanced rules). 
IDs with leading zeros or malformed ranges are skipped. All detected invalid IDs are collected, deduplicated, 
and summed to provide the clerk with a clean, trustworthy list. The ultimate objective is to support proper inventory management, 
prevent downstream system errors, and maintain data integrity within the North Pole Gift Shop.
